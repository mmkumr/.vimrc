# swapescape


This file is for linux users. First type this below commands in terminal after installing git.

git clone https://github.com/mmkumr/swapescape/

<code>cp GitRepo/swapescape.sh ~/.swapescape.sh</code>

I have added the swapescape.sh. If you run this file then your escape and caplock key will be interchanged when vim editor will open and when you will exit vim then it will change keyboard layout to default. Instead of running this code again and again'sh swapescape.sh file_name'(without quotes) you can simply do is you can add this line to you .bashrc/your default terminal file alias vim="sh full_file_path/swapescape.sh. Then you can simply type vim file_name and run this file.

Note:- Swapescape.sh is for qwerty keyboard users.
