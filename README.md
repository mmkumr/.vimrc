# vimrc


In this repository I have added my .vimrc file. Which makes vim easy for using for basic tasks

This file is for linux users. First type this below commands in terminal after installing git.

git clone https://github.com/mmkumr/vimrc/

<code>cp vimrc/vimrc ~/.vimrc && cp vimrc/swapescape.sh ~/.swapescape.sh</code>

In this file I have added some of the basic configuration for vim. Like colour scheme, smart tab, if your delete button is not working in insert mode after adding this file your delete button will work. And many more configuration you can checkout .vimrc file I have added comments for better understanding.

I have also added the swapescape.sh. If you run this file then your escape and caplock key will be interchanged and vim editor will open when you will exit vim then it will change keyboard layout to default. Instead of running this code again and again'sh swapescape.sh file_name'(without quotes) you can simply do is you can add this line to you .bashrc file alias vim="sh full_file_path/swapescape.sh. Then you can simply type vim file_name and run this file.

Note:- Swapescape.sh is for qwerty keyboard users.
