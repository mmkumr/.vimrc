# vimrc
In this repository I have added my .vimrc file. Which makes vim easy for using for basic tasks

This file is for linux users.
First type this below commands in terminal after installing git.

git clone https://github.com/mmkumr/vimrc/

cp vimrc/.vimrc ~/.vimrc

Note:- After cloning this file .vimrc will be automatically hide for seeing that file you can press ctrl + h for showing hidden files

In this file I have added some of the basic configuration for vim. Like colour scheme, smart tab, if your delete button is not working in insert mode after adding this file your delete button will work.
And many more configuration you can checkout .vimrc file I have added comments for better understanding.
And I have added swapescape file for the user who are using qwerty keyboard if you will add this file to startup application by following process :-

1. Press super key and type startup applications.
2. Then click on add button then in the command text box you can type 'bash full_path_of_file' then save.

Now after that when you will login then your function of capslock and escape key will be interchanged automatically this is can be usefull because we use escape key more times than caplock.
